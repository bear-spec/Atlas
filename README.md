# e-plantShopping

e-plantShopping is a React-based shopping cart application for an online
plant shop called Paradise Nursery.

Users can browse plants by category, view plant details such as images,
names, descriptions, and prices, add plants to a shopping cart, and manage
cart items by increasing or decreasing quantities.

The application uses Redux for state management and provides a smooth,
user-friendly e-commerce experience.
